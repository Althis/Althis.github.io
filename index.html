        <h1>Re-Wired Dataset Annotation Guidelines</h1>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in becoming an annotator for the Re-Wired Dataset. In this document, you will find all information you need to start annotating.</p>
    
        <h2>The Task</h2>
        <p>Our current objective is to expand a currently existing dataset with further linguistic information about the multi-layered objectives each person performs when communicating. The dataset is comprised of transcribed conversations in which an expert in a field explains some concept to multiple people at varying levels of education: child, teenager, undergraduate, graduate and expert.</p>
        <p>Your task as an annotator will be, given a transcript of one of these conversations, to use a highlighting tool to mark which “acts” are present in different parts of the text. These acts highlight some unspoken objectives present in the text. For example, the text
            “Do you understand that?”
            could be said to have both an objective of asking a yes/no question and checking for understanding.</p>
    
        <h2>Act Categories</h2>
        <p>We organize the acts we care about in 3 categories, each with 10 acts: dialogue acts, explanation acts, and teaching acts, each representing actions at a different level of the dialogue.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dialogue Acts: focus on basic mechanics in a dialogue between two people</li>
            <li>Explanation Acts: focus on mechanics of explaining concepts</li>
            <li>Teaching Acts: focus on conversation mechanics in terms of lesson planning and didactics</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Video Tutorial</h2>
        <p>For streamlined information on the annotation study, please watch the video:.</p>

        <h2 id="dialogue-acts">Dialogue Acts</h2>
        <p>Dialogue Acts refer to the most basic actions in a conversation between two interlocutors. These acts are concerned with the objectives present in the sentence structure itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="d01">
                <h3>D01 - Check Question</h3><br>
                <p> This act refers to any span that asks or suggests a question that can be confirmed or disconfirmed. The reason we write confirmed/disconfirmed instead of yes/no is that sometimes questions will have a negative response as a sign of confirmation. The most important aspect of this type of act however is just that it establishes an accompanying expectation, and that expectation might be confirmed or discomfirmed subsequently. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Question ✓ Confirming/Disconfirming answer expected
            </li>
            <li id="d02">
                <h3>D02 - What/How Question</h3><br>
                <p> Much like the Check Question act, this act also asks a question, but instead it refers to one that expects more information than just confirmation/disconfirmation. Specifically, this acts asks (or implies) a “what” or “how” question. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Question ✓ Informing statement expected answer
            </li>
            <li id="d03">
                <h3>D03 - Other Question</h3><br>
                <p> There are other questions we will not cover in this annotation. These include rhetorical questions, and “when”/”which”/”where” questions, but may include others we haven’t thought about. Regardless, if anything is a question and doesn’t fit in the previous 2 acts, this is where it goes. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Question ✓ Doesn’t fit acts D01 or D02
            </li>
            <li id="d04">
                <h3>D04 - Confirming Answer</h3><br>
                <p> This act represents a response that confirms the explicit assumptions of the previous question. This act most often presents itself as an affirmative statement, but might come in the form of a question (E.g.: “Yes?”) when the interlocutor is unsure, or as a reiteration of the previous statement. It is also important to highlight that the difference between this and a statement of agreement (D07) is that an “answer” always follows a “question”, while the agreement statement is unprompted. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Response to a yes/no question ✓ Confirms the expectation of conversation partner<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May include paraphrase/repetition of the original statement. However, if new information is added, that span counts as Informing Statement instead
            </li>
            <li id="d05">
                <h3>D05 - Disconfirming Answer</h3><br>
                <p> The opposite of the above. These include sarcastic affirmative responses (E.g.: “Yeah right…”), so it is up to you as an annotator to use the context of the conversation to decide if a response is confirming or disconfirming the previous question. Much like the confirming answer act, this act also always follows as a question. If it is impossible to determine a question prior to this act, then it probably is not an answer, but some other kind of act. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Response to a yes/no question ✓ Disconfirms the expectation of conversation partner<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May include paraphrase/repetition of the original statement. However, if new information is added, that span counts as Informing Statement instead
            </li>
            <li id="d06">
                <h3>D06 - Other Answer</h3><br>
                <p> Any other kind of direct response to a question that does not fit into Confirming Answer (D04), Disconfirming Answer (D05), or Informing Statement (D06). These are often ellipses (e.g.: “hm…”) or non-verbal responses (e.g.: “[both laugh]”). The important criteria for this act is just that the span is a direct response to a question, but doesn’t fit into any of the 3 acts above. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Response to a question ✓ Any answer that doesn’t fit into acts D04, D05, and D07
            </li>
            <li id="d07">
                <h3>D07 - Agreeing Statement</h3><br>
                <p> Agreeing statements are free expressions of agreement with some information previously stated by the other interlocutor. Agreeing statements differ from answers because they are not necessarily preceded by a question. If preceded by a question, the preferred act is always either Confirming Answer (D04) or Disconfirming Answer (D05) or Other Answer (D06), but if those for some reason do not fit the criteria, the act might be an agreeing statement instead. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Unrequested affirmation of agreement<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May be followed by repetition or paraphrase of previous information
            </li>
            <li id="d08">
                <h3>D08 - Disagreeing Statement</h3><br>
                <p> Much like the Agreeing Statements (D07), disagreeing statements are free expressions of disagreement with some previous statement of the interlocutor. They often come connected to some explanation or reasoning for the disagreement, which should be considered as part of the act. If the statement under consideration comes right after a question, always check if the statement wouldn’t fit better under one of the Answer acts first (D04, D05, D06), as those have priority when following questions. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Unrequested affirmation of agreement<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May be followed by reasoning behind disagreement.
            </li>
            <li id="d09">
                <h3>D09 - Informing Statement</h3><br>
                <p> This is one of the most important acts. It represents any part of the conversation that adds new information to the conversation. This information might be as big as a deep complicated technical concept (e.g.: “quantum mechanics depends on…”) or mostly inconsequential to the topic (“I loved physics in high-school”). The most important aspect to remember when distinguishing this from other acts is that all previous acts either request or reiterate information, while this is the only act in our inventory that ADDS information to the conversation. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Statement that adds new information to the conversation
            </li>
            <li id="d10">
                <h3>D10 - Action-directing Statement</h3><br>
                <p> This act refers to spans that either ask or inform about how to proceed or take action (or not) with some proposition that might or might not have been suggested by a previous span. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Statement that suggests or informs about possible actions ✓ Request for action (of any kind) ✓ Suggestion of possible action (or lack of action)
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 id="explanation-acts">Explanation Acts</h2>
        <p>Explanation acts address a deeper structure in a conversation in which one interlocutor (the explainer) attempts to explain a concept to another (the explainee).</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="e01">
                <h3>E01 - Test Understanding</h3><br>
                <p> This move happens when one of the interlocutors (usually the explainer), tests whether the information on the concept being explained was properly understood. This act might be as simple as asking a yes/no question (e.g.: “do you get that?”), or as thorough as asking a question that can only be answered if the explainee actually understood the concept (“so if I wanted to hide my identity online, how could I […]?”). This act is distinguished from Test Prior Knowledge (E02) because it specifically tests information given during the conversation about the main topic at hand. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong>
                ✓ Check if previous information in the conversation was understood
            </li>
            <li id="e02">
                <h3>E02 - Test Prior Knowledge</h3><br>
                <p> Tests what the interlocutor already knows. This can be in broad terms (e.g.: “have you studied algebra in school?”) and/or in more specific subjects (“have you heard about how capillarity affects water droplets?”). The critical aspect of this move is that it is primarily not directly related to the explanation, but instead provides one of the parties with the background information they will need to build some concept up. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Question ✓ Check if information previously unintroduced is understood
            </li>
            <li id="e03">
                <h3>E03 - Provide Explanation</h3><br>
                <p> The main act we are interested in. By providing an explanation one of the parties attempts to build a concept in the mind of the other interlocutor. This concept might be correct, incorrect, might be accompanied by examples, or metaphors. The only important part for this act is that these utterances will seek to build a mechanistic idea of the entire, or parts of the main concept being explored in the conversation. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                Either:<br>
                ✓ Provide entirely new explanation about the main concept of the conversation<br>
                or<br>
                ✓ Explore a different angle or paraphrase previous explanation
            </li>
            <li id="e04">
                <h3>E04 - Request Explanation</h3><br>
                <p> This act represents an explicit request for an explanation of the current topic or a tangential topic. This act may look similar to Test Understanding, when one of the interlocutors tests understanding by asking for an example or paraphrased explanation. The distinction between these is that the Request Explanation move is always an honest request for new information, while E01 is often rhetorical/requests previously established information. Instead, when Requesting Explanation, the requester always honestly desires the new information, instead of just testing if the concept previously given to the interlocutor is understood. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Honest request explanation of current or tangential topic  ✓ Usually request is for either new information or re-structured information
            </li>
            <li id="e05">
                <h3>E05 - Signal Understanding</h3><br>
                <p> Any verbal or non-verbal signal that states understanding. This act can be used as a response to E01 (Test Understanding), or might be unprompted. The concept might be properly or incorrectly understood. The only important aspect is that it signals the perceived idea of understanding by the speaker. It is optional for this act to include a paraphrase or example to show that the concept was properly understood. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Provide some signal of having understood previous given information<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May include a paraphrase or example of what was understood
            </li>
            <li id="e06">
                <h3>E06 - Signal Non-understanding</h3><br>
                <p> Any verbal or non-verbal signal that makes clear the interlocutor does not believe to have understood the explanation given. Much like with Signal Understanding (E06), the important aspect here is the belief in the interlocutor to NOT have properly understood the concept. In our explanations, the explainer is also assumed to have the correct understanding of the concept, so statements of disagreement with the explanation given by the explainer also count as Signal Non-Understanding, and might or might not be followed with a further request for explanation. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Provide some signal of not having understood the previously given explanation<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May include an explanation of why something was not understood or counter-example. Requests for explanation following this are themselves labeled as E04
            </li>
            <li id="e07">
                <h3>E07 - Provide Feedback</h3><br>
                <p> Upon receiving a signal on understanding, the interlocutor matches the response to their own understanding and gives feedback. This feedback is either positive, which usually prompts the advancement on the conversation, or incorrect, which usually prompts a correction or Provide Assistance (E08). </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Give confirmation of correct understanding or correct previously incorrect statement
            </li>
            <li id="e08">
                <h3>E08 - Provide Assistance</h3><br>
                <p> This act accompanies either a signal of non-understanding or a statement of incorrect understanding. The goal of the interlocutor is to facilitate understanding, usually through hints, analogies or examples. There is some overlap of the utterances from this class and Provide Explanation(E03). The main way of deciding between the two is the context around the utterance. Was an initial explanation already tried, and this is a further explanation with the primary goal of assistance? If so, this is E08. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Response to non-understanding or incorrect understanding ✓ Provide paraphrase, example or hint of previous information to facilitate understanding
            </li>
            <li id="e09">
                <h3>E09 - Provide Extraneous Information</h3><br>
                <p> In a conversation, interlocutors will often share information that is unrelated to the main explanation topic, like personal details, greetings, etc. These all go here. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Provide information unrelated to the current topic

                <h3>E10 - Other Act</h3><br>
                <p> This list of 10 acts is far from complete, so any other act that doesn’t fit the above 9 acts should instead be placed here. If you are having trouble deciding whether to label an act as E10 or not to label it at all, remember that what we want to capture is the OBJECTIVE behind parts of the dialogue. Most conversations include connecting material that can seem inconsequential to its major goals, but every turn is at least part of an act. So here is a useful rule of thumb: every turn in the transcript has at least one act, and if the turn doesn’t fit any of the above acts, it is E10. If the span you are considering can be thought of as just supporting another act, it probably can be left blank or be included in the main act under consideration. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Any other act not described here
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    
        <h2 id="teaching-acts">Teaching Acts</h2>
        <p>Teaching acts map parts of a conversation to steps in several teaching models, such as “concept building” and “problem-solving”. Teaching acts function differently than the previous acts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="t01">
                <h3>T01 - Assessing Prior Knowledge</h3><br>
                <p> The act of checking what the student knows before starting a lesson. Usually happens at the beginning of the lesson, before the lesson proposal, as this is an important element in planning what the lesson will be. Sometimes it also happens in the middle of the lesson when the teacher notices the conspicuous lack of some knowledge they had assumed the student to have. Again, this act is relegated to checking for PRIOR knowledge, that means it doesn’t include knowledge taught during the lesson itself. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Check for prior knowledge ✓State prior knowledge
            </li>
            <li id="t02">
                <h3>T02 - Lesson Proposal</h3><br>
                <p> Proposes the steps that will be taken during the lesson and ask for consent/agreement in moving on with the plan. This act is often overlooked, but we have theory saying that it is important for quality lessons, so we are dedicating one of our acts to getting information on it. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Propose what will be done in the lesson and why ✓Provide agreement with the current plan
            </li>
            <li id="t03">
                <h3>T03 - Active Experience</h3><br>
                <p> This act represents any active experimentation that happens during a class. The most important aspect of this act is that it is EXPERIENTIAL, which means that the teacher is proposing something to be experienced, and the student is exploring that experience freely. It is easy to envision this as the physical experimentation with some object the teacher brought to class, but it goes beyond that. Any time the teacher provides the student with some puzzle or question to explore, we also consider that a firsthand experience, as the student is freely and directly interacting with some mental concept. </p>
                <p> From the point of view of the teacher, it is important to differentiate this from T04 or T05. While the teacher might highlight aspects of the experience and give rules as to what is happening before or after giving the prototype for the student to explore, the important part of this step is that the teacher fosters FREE exploration of the prototype. Because of that, presenting of the prototype is T03, while guided comments on it are T04 or T05. </p>
                <p> From the point of view of the student, it is important to distinguish this act from T04 and T06/T07. First, T04 represents the critical highlighting of aspects of the prototype, so any uncritical or experiential utterances made about the prototype belong to T03. Second, T06 and T07 require that a verified concept already exists, because of that, any comparisons or generalizations about the prototype made before verification from the teacher that they are indeed correct belong here, while proposals of an understanding of the concept belong instead to T04. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Provide question/puzzle/prompt on topic that simulates firsthand experience ✓Engage with question/puzzle/prompt on topic
            </li>
            <li id="t04">
                <h3>T04 - Reflection</h3><br>
                <p> This act happens strictly after T03, as it relates to reflection on a direct experience. Reflection might happen directly after, or a bit later than its experience, but its most important aspect is that it configures indirect or meta-examination of an experience. That is, the experiment/prototype is no longer directly engaged with, but instead considered in reference to the original blind experimentation. </p>
                <p> This is also the step when gaps in knowledge or inconsistencies arise in students, and the statement of these gaps and/or inconsistencies is also relegated to this act, such as questions about the experience/concept, and disagreement/argumentation about the experience. The difference between these questions/disagreements/argumentation in T04 and T05 is that T04 always happens in relation to some experience provided by the teacher, while T05 relates to expressions of the concept itself. </p>
                <p> There is one particular case in which an explanation might directly relate to the experience, but isn’t labelled as T04; the direct solution of the question/prompt/puzzle given by the teacher. That is instead labelled as T05, Knowledge Statement. The reason for that is because in that case we consider that the connection to the experiment is only a springboard to facilitate talking about the lesson’s subject in a contextualized form. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Highlight aspects of the previous experience ✓Notice gaps/inconsistencies in knowledge ✓Act on those gaps via questions or statements
            </li>
            <li id="t05">
                <h3>T05 - Knowledge Statement</h3><br>
                <p> This is the act in which the concepts being taught are directly stated. In the case of practical knowledge, this usually means the direct statement of rules or procedures. For factual knowledge, this usually means the direct statement of these facts. </p>
                <p> Other explorations of the concept such as comparisons and applications are explored in T06 and T07 respectively. T05 instead deals with the matter of factly statement of the concept being taught, how it works and its underlying intricacies. </p>
                <p> There is a single case when a statement directly connected to the conclusion of an experiment/puzzle/question is not labelled as T04, and that is when it directly follows into addressing the concept of the lesson in its rule/fact form. In these cases, it is considered T05 instead. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Provide a solution to puzzle/prompt/question on topic ✓Establish a rule or factual knowledge
            </li>
            <li id="t06">
                <h3>T06 - Comparison</h3><br>
                <p> This act refers to the act of comparing the main concept of the lesson with other concepts and considering similarities and differences, pros and cons. When relating to ideas and theories, the main aspect of this act is criticality; this act deals direction to the goodness or badness of an idea. In cases where we are talking about factual knowledge, this is interpreted as the comparison of the events/facts discussed to other facts/events and the linking between those ideas. </p>
                <p> This act differs from T04 in that during T04 all ideas as to the experiment are still tentative. T06 instead happens only when the main concept of the lesson (the correct answer to the prototype, so to say) is already established. T06 also differs from T07 in that while T07 might suggest new applications for a concept, T07 is not critical about its advantages/disadvantages. That is instead under the purview of T06. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Notice how aspects of the concept/experience are similar/dissimilar to others ✓Address benefits and drawbacks of the concept/experience
            </li>
            <li id="t07">
                <h3>T07 - Generalization</h3><br>
                <p> This act primarily establishes how the concept explored applies to many situations outside of the most obvious one explored under the lesson, such as any T03 if provided. In the case of ideas and theories, this relates to the generalization of the rules/concepts and the application of that to new scenarios. When dealing with factual knowledge, this act represents the abstraction of takeaways and learning points from these facts. </p>
                <p> The difference between this act and T04 is that while both might look at deriving abstract concepts in relation to some experience, the direction of the relationship is inverted. T07 refers to coming from an abstract concept and applying it to explain experiences, while T04 comes up with new tentative concepts to explain experience. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Notice how aspects of the concept/experience are similar/dissimilar to others ✓Address benefits and drawbacks of the concept/experience
            </li>
            <li id="t08">
                <h3>T08 - Test Understanding</h3><br>
                <p> This act might look very similar to many of the previously discussed acts, as the teacher or student might want to test many aspects of the discussed concept. The main and most important difference that sets it apart from any other act is that the objective of the interlocutor is primarily to test if some concept previously established and explored was received correctly. In that way, T08 is not used to explore new facets of the concept, but instead primarily to detect if some previously explored facet is properly understood. Some reader discretion is necessary when guessing the goals of the interlocutor, but we trust that the context in the lesson should be sufficient to make an informed decision as to the goal of the act. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Check if the taught concept was properly understood via example, puzzle, paraphrasing or analogy ✓Respond to the knowledge check ✓Provide feedback on whether the concept was well understood or didn’t quite meet the mark yet 
            </li>
            <li id="t09">
                <h3>T09 - Engagement Management</h3><br>
                <p> Teaching involved many acts that primarily serve to maintain the classroom context in such a way to facilitate effective teaching. The most determinant criteria for this act is that the span isn’t directly none of the previously described teaching acts, but also supports them in a direct way, such as by creating rapport between teacher and student, maintaining engagement of the student, or facilitating the following teaching acts. Examples of such can be jokes, sharing personal experiences, pointing out how certain parts of the concept directly relate to the student’s interest, etc. </p>
                <p> It is important to re-iterate that this act has lower importance than previous teaching acts and that even if a previous act can be seen to maintain engagement in the conversation, labelling with the previous act is preferred to this one. This act instead exists directly as a catch-all category to all engagement-maintaining interactions that cannot be better described as any of the previous acts. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Interactions that maintain engagement in the conversation, such as jokes, pointing out, sharing personal experiences, etc
            </li>
            <li id="t10">
                <h3>T10 - Other Act</h3><be>
                <p> Any other act that doesn’t fit the above 9 acts should instead be placed here. If you are having trouble deciding whether to label an act as T10 or not to label it at all, remember that what we want to capture is the OBJECTIVE behind parts of the dialogue. Most conversations include connecting material that can seem inconsequential to it’s major goals, but every turn is at least part of an act. So here is a useful rule of thumb: every turn in the transcript has at least one act, and if the turn doesn’t fit any of the above acts, it is T10. If the span you are considering can be thought of as just supporting another act, it probably can be left blank or be included in the main act under consideration. </p>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓Any act that is not covered under the above.
