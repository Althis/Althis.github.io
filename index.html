        <h1>Re-Wired Dataset Annotation Guidelines</h1>
        <p>Thank you for your interest in becoming an annotator for the Re-Wired Dataset. In this document, you will find all information you need to start annotating.</p>
    
        <h2>The Task</h2>
        <p>Our current objective is to expand a currently existing dataset with further linguistic information about the multi-layered objectives each person performs when communicating. The dataset is comprised of transcribed conversations in which an expert in a field explains some concept to multiple people at varying levels of education: child, teenager, undergraduate, graduate and expert.</p>
        <p>Your task as an annotator will be, given a transcript of one of these conversations, to use a highlighting tool to mark which “acts” are present in different parts of the text. These acts highlight some unspoken objectives present in the text. For example, the text
            “Do you understand that?”
            could be said to have both an objective of asking a yes/no question and checking for understanding.</p>
    
        <h2>Act Categories</h2>
        <p>We organize the acts we care about in 3 categories, each with 10 acts: dialogue acts, explanation acts, and teaching acts, each representing actions at a different level of the dialogue.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dialogue Acts: focus on basic mechanics in a dialogue between two people</li>
            <li>Explanation Acts: focus on mechanics of explaining concepts</li>
            <li>Teaching Acts: focus on conversation mechanics in terms of lesson planning and didactics</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Video Tutorial</h2>
        <p>For streamlined information on the annotation study, please watch the video:.</p>

        <h2 id="dialogue-acts">Dialogue Acts</h2>
        <p>Dialogue Acts refer to the most basic actions in a conversation between two interlocutors. These acts are concerned with the objectives present in the sentence structure itself.</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="d01">
                <h3>D01 - Check Question</h3><br>
                This act refers to any span that asks or suggests a question that can be confirmed or disconfirmed. The reason we write confirmed/disconfirmed instead of yes/no is that sometimes questions will have a negative response as a sign of confirmation. The most important aspect of this type of act however is just that it establishes an accompanying expectation, and that expectation might be confirmed or discomfirmed subsequently.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Question ✓ Confirming/Disconfirming answer expected
            </li>
            <li id="d02">
                <h3>D02 - What/How Question</h3><br>
                Much like the Check Question act, this act also asks a question, but instead it refers to one that expects more information than just confirmation/disconfirmation. Specifically, this acts asks (or implies) a “what” or “how” question.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Question ✓ Informing statement expected answer
            </li>
            <li id="d03">
                <h3>D03 - Other Question</h3><br>
                There are other questions we will not cover in this annotation. These include rhetorical questions, and “when”/”which”/”where” questions, but may include others we haven’t thought about. Regardless, if anything is a question and doesn’t fit in the previous 2 acts, this is where it goes.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Question ✓ Doesn’t fit acts D01 or D02
            </li>
            <li id="d04">
                <h3>D04 - Confirming Answer</h3><br>
                This act represents a response that confirms the explicit assumptions of the previous question. This act most often presents itself as an affirmative statement, but might come in the form of a question (E.g.: “Yes?”) when the interlocutor is unsure, or as a reiteration of the previous statement. It is also important to highlight that the difference between this and a statement of agreement (D07) is that an “answer” always follows a “question”, while the agreement statement is unprompted.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Response to a yes/no question ✓ Confirms the expectation of conversation partner<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May include paraphrase/repetition of the original statement. However, if new information is added, that span counts as Informing Statement instead
            </li>
            <li id="d05">
                <h3>D05 - Disconfirming Answer</h3><br>
                The opposite of the above. These include sarcastic affirmative responses (E.g.: “Yeah right…”), so it is up to you as an annotator to use the context of the conversation to decide if a response is confirming or disconfirming the previous question. Much like the confirming answer act, this act also always follows as a question. If it is impossible to determine a question prior to this act, then it probably is not an answer, but some other kind of act.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Response to a yes/no question ✓ Disconfirms the expectation of conversation partner<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May include paraphrase/repetition of the original statement. However, if new information is added, that span counts as Informing Statement instead
            </li>
            <li id="d06">
                <h3>D06 - Other Answer</h3><br>
                Any other kind of direct response to a question that does not fit into Confirming Answer (D04), Disconfirming Answer (D05), or Informing Statement (D06). These are often ellipses (e.g.: “hm…”) or non-verbal responses (e.g.: “[both laugh]”). The important criteria for this act is just that the span is a direct response to a question, but doesn’t fit into any of the 3 acts above.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Response to a question ✓ Any answer that doesn’t fit into acts D04, D05, and D07
            </li>
            <li id="d07">
                <h3>D07 - Agreeing Statement</h3><br>
                Agreeing statements are free expressions of agreement with some information previously stated by the other interlocutor. Agreeing statements differ from answers because they are not necessarily preceded by a question. If preceded by a question, the preferred act is always either Confirming Answer (D04) or Disconfirming Answer (D05) or Other Answer (D06), but if those for some reason do not fit the criteria, the act might be an agreeing statement instead.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Unrequested affirmation of agreement<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May be followed by repetition or paraphrase of previous information
            </li>
            <li id="d08">
                <h3>D08 - Disagreeing Statement</h3><br>
                Much like the Agreeing Statements (D07), disagreeing statements are free expressions of disagreement with some previous statement of the interlocutor. They often come connected to some explanation or reasoning for the disagreement, which should be considered as part of the act. If the statement under consideration comes right after a question, always check if the statement wouldn’t fit better under one of the Answer acts first (D04, D05, D06), as those have priority when following questions.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Unrequested affirmation of agreement<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May be followed by reasoning behind disagreement.
            </li>
            <li id="d09">
                <h3>D09 - Informing Statement</h3><br>
                This is one of the most important acts. It represents any part of the conversation that adds new information to the conversation. This information might be as big as a deep complicated technical concept (e.g.: “quantum mechanics depends on…”) or mostly inconsequential to the topic (“I loved physics in high-school”). The most important aspect to remember when distinguishing this from other acts is that all previous acts either request or reiterate information, while this is the only act in our inventory that ADDS information to the conversation.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Statement that adds new information to the conversation
            </li>
            <li id="d10">
                <h3>D10 - Action-directing Statement</h3><br>
                This act refers to spans that either ask or inform about how to proceed or take action (or not) with some proposition that might or might not have been suggested by a previous span.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Statement that suggests or informs about possible actions ✓ Request for action (of any kind) ✓ Suggestion of possible action (or lack of action)
            </li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2 id="explanation-acts">Explanation Acts</h2>
        <p>Explanation acts address a deeper structure in a conversation in which one interlocutor (the explainer) attempts to explain a concept to another (the explainee).</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="e01">
                <h3>E01 - Test Understanding</h3><br>
                This move happens when one of the interlocutors (usually the explainer), tests whether the information on the concept being explained was properly understood. This act might be as simple as asking a yes/no question (e.g.: “do you get that?”), or as thorough as asking a question that can only be answered if the explainee actually understood the concept (“so if I wanted to hide my identity online, how could I […]?”). This act is distinguished from Test Prior Knowledge (E02) because it specifically tests information given during the conversation about the main topic at hand.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong>
                ✓ Check if previous information in the conversation was understood
            </li>
            <li id="e02">
                <h3>E02 - Test Prior Knowledge</h3><br>
                Tests what the interlocutor already knows. This can be in broad terms (e.g.: “have you studied algebra in school?”) and/or in more specific subjects (“have you heard about how capillarity affects water droplets?”). The critical aspect of this move is that it is primarily not directly related to the explanation, but instead provides one of the parties with the background information they will need to build some concept up.<br>

                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Question ✓ Check if information previously unintroduced is understood
            </li>
            <li id="e03">
                <h3>E03 - Provide Explanation</h3><br>
                The main act we are interested in. By providing an explanation one of the parties attempts to build a concept in the mind of the other interlocutor. This concept might be correct, incorrect, might be accompanied by examples, or metaphors. The only important part for this act is that these utterances will seek to build a mechanistic idea of the entire, or parts of the main concept being explored in the conversation.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                Either:<br>
                ✓ Provide entirely new explanation about the main concept of the conversation<br>
                or<br>
                ✓ Explore a different angle or paraphrase previous explanation
            </li>
            <li id="e04">
                <h3>E04 - Request Explanation</h3><br>
                This act represents an explicit request for an explanation of the current topic or a tangential topic. This act may look similar to Test Understanding, when one of the interlocutors tests understanding by asking for an example or paraphrased explanation. The distinction between these is that the Request Explanation move is always an honest request for new information, while E01 is often rhetorical/requests previously established information. Instead, when Requesting Explanation, the requester always honestly desires the new information, instead of just testing if the concept previously given to the interlocutor is understood.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Honest request explanation of current or tangential topic  ✓ Usually request is for either new information or re-structured information
            </li>
            <li id="e05">
                <h3>E05 - Signal Understanding</h3><br>
                Any verbal or non-verbal signal that states understanding. This act can be used as a response to E01 (Test Understanding), or might be unprompted. The concept might be properly or incorrectly understood. The only important aspect is that it signals the perceived idea of understanding by the speaker. It is optional for this act to include a paraphrase or example to show that the concept was properly understood.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Provide some signal of having understood previous given information<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May include a paraphrase or example of what was understood
            </li>
            <li id="e06">
                <h3>E06 - Signal Non-understanding</h3><br>
                Any verbal or non-verbal signal that makes clear the interlocutor does not believe to have understood the explanation given. Much like with Signal Understanding (E06), the important aspect here is the belief in the interlocutor to NOT have properly understood the concept. In our explanations, the explainer is also assumed to have the correct understanding of the concept, so statements of disagreement with the explanation given by the explainer also count as Signal Non-Understanding, and might or might not be followed with a further request for explanation.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Provide some signal of not having understood the previously given explanation<br>
                <strong>Optional:</strong><br>
                ✓ May include an explanation of why something was not understood or counter-example. Requests for explanation following this are themselves labeled as E04
            </li>
            <li id="e07">
                <h3>E07 - Provide Feedback</h3><br>
                Upon receiving a signal on understanding, the interlocutor matches the response to their own understanding and gives feedback. This feedback is either positive, which usually prompts the advancement on the conversation, or incorrect, which usually prompts a correction or Provide Assistance (E08).<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Give confirmation of correct understanding or correct previously incorrect statement
            </li>
            <li id="e08">
                <h3>E08 - Provide Assistance</h3><br>
                This act accompanies either a signal of non-understanding or a statement of incorrect understanding. The goal of the interlocutor is to facilitate understanding, usually through hints, analogies or examples. There is some overlap of the utterances from this class and Provide Explanation(E03). The main way of deciding between the two is the context around the utterance. Was an initial explanation already tried, and this is a further explanation with the primary goal of assistance?

                <h3>E09 - Provide Extraneous Information</h3><br>
                In a conversation, interlocutors will often share information that is unrelated to the main explanation topic, like personal details, greetings, etc. These all go here.<br>

                <h3>E10 - Other Act</h3><br>
                This list of 10 acts is far from complete, so any other act that doesn’t fit the above 9 acts should instead be placed here. If you are having trouble deciding whether to label an act as E10 or not to label it at all, remember that what we want to capture is the OBJECTIVE behind parts of the dialogue. Most conversations include connecting material that can seem inconsequential to its major goals, but every turn is at least part of an act. So here is a useful rule of thumb: every turn in the transcript has at least one act, and if the turn doesn’t fit any of the above acts, it is E10. If the span you are considering can be thought of as just supporting another act, it probably can be left blank or be included in the main act under consideration.<br>

        <h2 id="teaching-acts">Teaching Acts</h2>
        <p>Teaching acts map parts of a conversation to steps in several teaching models, such as “concept building” and “problem-solving”. Teaching acts function differently than the previous acts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="t01">
                <h3>T01 - Request Action</h3><br>
                The teacher requests the student to perform a specific action. This action can range from a simple task like “calculate the derivative of this function” to a more complex one like “solve this differential equation using the method we learned in the last lecture.” The teacher intends to prompt the student to engage in a task to demonstrate their understanding or develop a skill.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Request the student to perform a specific action or task
            </li>
            <li id="t02">
                <h3>T02 - Provide Solution</h3><br>
                The teacher presents a solution to a problem or task. This act usually follows a Request Action (T01) where the student has been asked to perform a task. The teacher provides the correct or intended solution, explaining the steps and processes involved. This move aims to demonstrate the proper way of solving the problem or completing the task.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Present solution to previously requested task
            </li>
            <li id="t03">
                <h3>T03 - Provide Feedback</h3><br>
                The teacher offers feedback on the student's performance or response. This feedback can be positive reinforcement for a correct answer or constructive criticism for an incorrect one. The goal is to guide the student's learning process by acknowledging correct understanding or providing insights into areas that need improvement.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Provide feedback on student's performance or response
            </li>
            <li id="t04">
                <h3>T04 - Provide Hint</h3><br>
                The teacher gives a hint or clue to assist the student in solving a problem or answering a question. Hints can come in various forms, such as suggesting an approach, providing a partial solution, or highlighting relevant information. The purpose is to support the student's problem-solving process while encouraging independent thinking.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Offer a hint or clue to guide student's problem-solving process
            </li>
            <li id="t05">
                <h3>T05 - Ask Socratic Question</h3><br>
                The teacher poses a Socratic question that prompts the student to think critically and analyze concepts. Socratic questions encourage deep understanding and reflection by challenging the student's assumptions, clarifying concepts, and exploring implications. This act aims to stimulate thoughtful engagement and discussion.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Pose a Socratic question to encourage critical thinking and reflection
            </li>
            <li id="t06">
                <h3>T06 - Elicit Student Explanation</h3><br>
                The teacher asks the student to explain a concept, solution, or reasoning. By eliciting the student's explanation, the teacher assesses the student's understanding, encourages active recall, and provides an opportunity for the student to articulate their thoughts. This act supports knowledge consolidation and communication skills.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Request student to explain a concept, solution, or reasoning
            </li>
            <li id="t07">
                <h3>T07 - Check Intuition</h3><br>
                The teacher engages the student's intuition by posing a question or scenario that challenges common misconceptions or preconceived notions. This move aims to guide the student toward a deeper, more accurate understanding of the topic by confronting and correcting intuitive errors.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Pose a question or scenario to challenge and correct intuitive errors
            </li>
            <li id="t08">
                <h3>T08 - Relate to Previous Knowledge</h3><br>
                The teacher connects the current topic to previously learned concepts or knowledge. By establishing links between new and existing information, the teacher helps the student integrate their understanding and build a coherent mental framework. This act supports knowledge retention and application.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Establish a connection between current topic and previous knowledge
            </li>
            <li id="t09">
                <h3>T09 - Summarize and Synthesize</h3><br>
                The teacher summarizes key points, concepts, or discussions and synthesizes them into a coherent overview. This act aims to highlight the main takeaways, reinforce learning, and provide a structured framework for organizing information.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Summarize and synthesize key points, concepts, or discussions
            </li>
            <li id="t10">
                <h3>T10 - Other Act</h3><br>
                Similar to the previous sections, this act serves as a catch-all category for teaching-related moves that don't fit into the above categories. It encompasses any other acts that involve guiding, instructing, or facilitating the learning process.<br>
                <strong>Selection Criteria:</strong><br>
                ✓ Any other act not described here that is related to teaching and instruction
